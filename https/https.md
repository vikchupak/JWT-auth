Session key exchange uses asymmetric encription;\
Data encripted using symmetric encription;

1 SSL/TLS (digital) certificates:
- __Root certificates => pre-installed in OS (and probably browser); self-signed; contain public keys__;
- Intermediate certificates;
- Self-signed certificate;
- Certificate chain;

1.1 Digital signatures in SSL/TLS:

Digital signatures are used for
- Certificate validation
- To sign "authenticated exchange key" used during Handshake to establish session key

How signarure happens in terms of public/private keys\
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cics-ts/5.4?topic=protection-public-key-encryption

- Information encrypted using the public key can be decrypted only with the private key.
- Information encrypted using the private key can be decrypted only with the public key.

SHA(Secure Hash Algorithm)

Sender:\
hash = SHA/bcrypt func(data);\
sign = encript(hash, sign's private key);\
output => data + sign + (sign's public key);

Consumer:\
input => data + sign + (sign's public key);\
hash1 = SHA/bcrypt func(data);\
hash2 = decript(sign, sign's public key);\
hash1 == hash2;

=================================================================================

2 Handshake (proccess of exchnge "session key" between client and server):
- Session key;\
TLS 1.2 uses RSA(Rivest-Shamir-Adelman) algorithm; doesn't have Perfect forward secrecy; client generates "session key";\
TLS 1.3 uses DH(Diffie-Hellman) or enhanced ECDH(Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) algorithm; has Perfect forward secrecy; client generates: private x and public g, n, g^x%n, which are sent publicly;
